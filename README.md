Converting Pellagatti et al.'s (2020) Algorithm 1 Pseudo Code to R (Original Paper Titled: Generalized Mixed Effects Random Forest: a flexible approach to predict university student dropout).

# Funding

This code was written to support research conducted under [IES Grant Number R305S210005 (Farley, Scalise, Tate, and Zvoch, 2021)](https://ies.ed.gov/funding/grantsearch/details.asp?ID=4533). 

# Conferences

Results with this fitting and prediction function were at SREE 2022:
